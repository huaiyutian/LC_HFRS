Code for: Anthropogenic disturbance indirectly increases zoonotic disease risk through reductions in rodent biodiversity Notes on the code To run, you need a Matlab toolbox called "DRAM": DRAM is a combination of two ideas for improving the efficiency of Metropolis-Hastings type Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, Delayed Rejection and Adaptive Metropolis. This page explains the basic ideas behind DRAM and provides examples and Matlab code for the computations.(see http://helios.fmi.fi/~lainema/dram/)

About code folder: 
main file : f1.m; funciton dependencies:f3.m,f4.m and MCMC DRAM toolbox;
All senarios can get in f_ITR100.m (modelsimu.m is function dependency)
